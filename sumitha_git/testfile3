approach 2) not using the readline but a for loop
# Open the file in read mode
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    # Read the file line by line
    for line in file:
        # Print each line
        print(line.strip())  # Use strip() to remove any extra newlines
print('----- all the lines in the file is processed ----- ')
